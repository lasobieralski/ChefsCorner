ChefsCorner is a dynamic, user-friendly recipe management app built with modern web technologies. It allows users to add, view, edit, favorite, and delete recipes, all while providing a polished user experience across devices.

Project Goals & Features Achieved

1. Recipe Management
   Users can add, view, edit, and delete their own recipes.
   A validated form ensures all input fields are filled properly.

2. Save Favorites
   Users can favorite recipes with a ‚≠ê toggle.
   Favorite recipes are stored in localStorage for persistent access.

3. Search & Filter
   Recipes can be filtered by category or search bar input (ingredients, tags, or title).
   Includes sorting by title or date and favorites-only toggle.

4. Dynamic Recipe Fetching
   Recipes are fetched from a local JSON file (recipes.json) instead of being hard-coded.

5. Responsive Design
   CSS Grid, Flexbox, and mobile-first media queries create a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

6. Smooth Navigation & UI Components
   A dynamic navigation bar, modal windows for login and recipes, and category cards enhance the UX.
   Navigation is loaded dynamically on each page using JavaScript partials.

7. CSS Animation
   Subtle animations (like fading recipe transitions and hover effects) enhance visual feedback and interactivity.

8. Seamless Page Transitions via URL Parameters
   Clicking a "View" button or using a URL like
   myrecipes.html?id=2 or ccrecipes.html?id=5
   automatically opens the correct recipe modal, allowing for:
   - Bookmarking
   - Sharing links
   - Deep linking

9. Modular JavaScript
   JavaScript files are separated by feature:
   - recipe.js, myrecipes.js, storage.js, ccmain.js, etc.
   Organized and imported using ES modules.

10. Accessibility & UX
    - Semantic HTML, form label accessibility
    - Mobile-friendly tap targets
    - Clear feedback on interactions
    - Hidden buttons only when needed
    - Clean, readable fonts and good contrast

Summary

ChefsCorner is a fully functional, accessible, and visually polished recipe manager SPA (Single Page Application-style), designed with users in mind. Whether browsing, sharing, or saving recipes, the app offers a personalized experience with features you'd expect in a professional-grade web app.
